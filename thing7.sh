# This script is designed to trace the origins of all incoming requests and redirect them back to sender in a reverse denial of service attack

# First, we define the variables that will be used
IPTABLES="/sbin/iptables"
OUTPUT_FILE="/var/log/reverse_attack.txt"

# Next, we create the output file if it doesn't already exist
touch $OUTPUT_FILE

# Then, we set up the iptables rules to trace the origins of all incoming requests
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "Incoming Request: " --log-level 7 --log-uid

# Now, we set up the iptables rules to redirect all incoming requests back to sender
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

# Finally, we run a traceroute and save the output to the output file
traceroute -n -i eth0 -m 15 >> $OUTPUT_FILE

# This script uses iptables to trace the origins of all incoming requests and redirect them back to sender in a reverse denial of service attack. This can be used to protect a server from malicious requests. The traceroute command is used to show the traceroute and IP address of each request, and the output is saved in the output file.
